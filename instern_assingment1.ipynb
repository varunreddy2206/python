    "#    - int: Represents integers (e.g., `1`, `42`, `-7`).\n",
    "#    - float: Represents floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.01`).\n",
    "#    - str: Represents strings of characters (e.g., `\"hello\"`, `\"Python\"`).\n",
    "#    - list: Represents ordered collections of elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`).\n",

    "#    These data types are known as Python’s core data types because:\n",
    "#    - They are built into the Python language.\n",
    "#    - They provide the foundation for more complex data structures.\n",
    "#    - They are optimized for performance and usability.\n",

    "#    - Immutable means that once an object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify it actually creates a new object.\n",
    "#    - The three core data types that are considered immutable in Python are:\n",

    "#    - Three data types that fall into the sequence category are:\n",

    "#      2. list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)\n",

    "#    - Mapping refers to a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value.\n",
    "#    - The dictionary (`dict`) data type is based on mapping in Python (e.g., `{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}`). \n",
